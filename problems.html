        <p>The first comprehensive federal law to address this problem in persons, the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act  (TVPA) of 2000. 
          The law is to provide for the protection of trafficking victims and the prosecution of traffickers within the United States.</p>
        <p>The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act (JVTA) was introduced in 2015, containing a number of important amendments that strengthen services for victims. 
          Its goal is to increase services for survivors of human trafficking as well as to strengthen and empower law enforcement and first responders.</p>

      <div class="victims_split">
        <p>The International Labour Organization (ILO) in 2005 also indicated that about 2.4 million people are victims of trafficking at any given time, and that profits from trafficking are about $32 billion per year. 
          Furthermore, the FBI estimates that over 100,000 children and young women are trafficked in America today with the age around nine to the average of eleven. 
          In the percentage of the world's human trafficking victims, women make up two thirds. 
          Even though both genders can be the victims of human trafficking, men still have significantly lower percentages than women.

      <h1>How California Deal With Human Trafficking?</h1>
      <div class="problems_split">
        <p>
          Currently human trafficking is defined as a non-serious and non-violent crime. 
          So, the act of human trafficking cannot be considered a strike under California's Three Strikes law.
          On top of that, California consistently ranks number one in the nation in the number of human trafficking cases reported to the National Human Trafficking Hotline.
          SB 1042 will include human trafficking in the lists of crimes that are defined as serious and violent under California law, making the crime a strike under the Three Strikes law. 
          However, it has failed to passage the Committee.
          Despite that, in 2013 the State enacted SB 1193, mandating that specified businesses and other estalblishments are required to post a human trafficking model notice created by the Attorent General's Office.
          Moreover, California also has provided substantial funding to expand support programs for human trafficking survivors and Family Justice Centers
